  The list of meetings suggested in an email message is returned in the `meetingSuggestions` property of the `Entities`
  object that is returned when the `getEntities` or `getEntitiesByType` method is called on the active item.


  The start and end values are string representations of a `Date` object that contains the date and time at which the
  suggested meeting is to begin and end. The values are in the default time zone specified for the current user.
