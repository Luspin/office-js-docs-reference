summary: >-
  Represents a collection of entities found in an email message or appointment. Read mode only.


  The `Entities` object is a container for the entity arrays returned by the `getEntities` and `getEntitiesByType`
  methods when the item (either an email message or an appointment) contains one or more entities that have been found
  by the server. You can use these entities in your code to provide additional context information to the viewer, such
  as a map to an address found in the item, or to open a dialer for a phone number found in the item.


  If no entities of the type specified in the property are present in the item, the property associated with that entity
  is null. For example, if a message contains a street address and a phone number, the addresses property and
  phoneNumbers property would contain information, and the other properties would be null.


  To be recognized as an address, the string must contain a United States postal address that has at least a subset of
  the elements of a street number, street name, city, state, and zip code.


  To be recognized as a phone number, the string must contain a North American phone number format.


  Entity recognition relies on natural language recognition that is based on machine learning of large amounts of data.
  The recognition of an entity is non-deterministic and success sometimes relies on the particular context in the item.


  When the property arrays are returned by the `getEntitiesByType` method, only the property for the specified entity
  contains data; all other properties are null.
