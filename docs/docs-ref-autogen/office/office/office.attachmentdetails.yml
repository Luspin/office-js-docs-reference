      **Warning**: While the `contentType` value is a direct lookup of the attachment's extension, the internal mapping
      isn't actively maintained so this property has been deprecated. If you require specific types, grab the
      attachment's extension and process accordingly. For details, refer to the [related blog
      post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/outlook-javascript-api-deprecation-for-attachmentdetails-contenttype-property/)<!--

      includes a file extension in Outlook on Mac, but excludes the extension on the web or Windows.
