      Overrides the JavaScript `toJSON()` method in order to provide more useful output when an API object is passed to
      `JSON.stringify()`<!-- -->. (`JSON.stringify`<!-- -->, in turn, calls the `toJSON` method of the object that is
      passed to it.) Whereas the original Excel.DataConnectionCollection object is an API object, the `toJSON` method
      returns a plain JavaScript object (typed as `Excel.Interfaces.DataConnectionCollectionData`<!-- -->) that contains
      shallow copies of any loaded child properties from the original object.
