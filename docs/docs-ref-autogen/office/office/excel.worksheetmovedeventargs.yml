summary: >-
  Notifies when a worksheet is moved within a workbook.


  If a worksheet is moved from one position within the workbook to another via the Excel UI, then this API will trigger
  an event. Note that if the position of a worksheet changes as a result of moving a different worksheet, then this
  event won't trigger for both position changes. This event only triggers for the primary worksheet move, and not any
  worksheet position changes that occur as a result of that primary move.
